This folder covers the process of using the midi Keyboard that I made with a raspberry pi zero w to make a nice headless ready to go
synthetiser. 

This setup will allow to use the MIDI keyboard as MIDI controller (as seen on the main page of this project) or as an awesome standalone
synthetiser.

I have to thank youtuber Marky Shaw for providing an excellent video guide on how to do this.

IMPORTANT!!!! 

If you already have a MIDI keyboard or if you managed to make your own USB keyboard that can be recognised as MIDI (for example,
the arduino MEGA with the USB driver that allows to be flashed as MIDI) Just follow his guide on how to make a Raspberry Pi Zero
synth without Xorg.

Because I have the crappy Arduino with the translation script, things are a little bit more difficult.
